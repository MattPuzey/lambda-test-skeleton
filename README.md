# Lambda test skeleton

This project provides a project structure that supports local lambda function testing including lambda
profiling/ billing estimations. Python packages such as [Emulambda](https://github.com/fugue/emulambda/) and
[python-lambda-local](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-lambda-local). Emulambda is not in the python package index
so it should be installed on macOS with:

```
pip3 install -e emulambda --user
```
